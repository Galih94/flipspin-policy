    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p>These Terms and Conditions apply to the <strong>FlipSpin</strong> app (hereby referred to as the "Application") for mobile devices, developed by <strong>Galih Samodra Wicaksono</strong> (hereby referred to as the "Service Provider") as an <strong>ad-supported service</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these terms. Please read them carefully before use. Unauthorized copying or modification of the Application or any part of it is strictly prohibited. This includes attempts to extract the source code, create derivative versions, or translate it into other languages.</p>
    <p>All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the exclusive property of the Service Provider.</p>

    <h2>Usage and Modifications</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider aims to make the Application as useful and efficient as possible. Therefore, the Service Provider reserves the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Modify or update the Application at any time</li>
        <li>Introduce service charges (if any), which will be clearly communicated in advance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data and Security</h2>
    <p>The Application may store and process personal data provided by you, in accordance with our Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your device and access to the Application.</p>
    <p><strong>Jailbreaking or rooting</strong> your device may compromise its security and affect the functionality of the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against such actions.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Application may use third-party services with their own terms and conditions. You can find their terms below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network and Charges</h2>
    <p>Certain functions of the Application require an internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data). The Service Provider is not responsible if the Application doesn’t function fully due to lack of internet access or mobile data limits.</p>
    <p>If you use the Application outside of a Wi-Fi zone, your mobile provider’s charges may apply, including data roaming fees. By using the Application, you accept full responsibility for these charges. If you are not the bill payer, it is assumed you have received permission from the bill payer.</p>

    <h2>Device and Availability</h2>
    <p>It is your responsibility to ensure your device is charged and capable of running the Application. The Service Provider is not liable if your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Application.</p>
    <p>While the Service Provider strives to keep the Application updated, information may rely on third-party sources. Therefore, the Service Provider does not guarantee its accuracy and accepts no liability for any loss resulting from your reliance on it.</p>

    <h2>Updates and Termination</h2>
    <p>The Application may be updated periodically to meet OS requirements or enhance functionality. You agree to accept these updates to continue using the Application. The Service Provider may terminate the Application or your access to it at any time, without notice.</p>
    <p>Upon termination:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All rights granted to you under these Terms will end</li>
        <li>You must stop using the Application and delete it from your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and it is your responsibility to review them periodically.</p>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-06-17</p>
