<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the FlipSpin app (the "Application") developed by Galih Samodra Wicaksono (the "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported application. The app is provided “AS IS” and is intended for general audiences.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>The Application does not collect personally identifiable information from users. There is no login, account creation, or manual data entry required to use the app.</p>

<p>However, the app may use third-party services such as AdMob (by Google) which may collect certain information automatically for the purpose of showing ads. This information may include, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Device information (such as device type, OS version, unique identifiers)</li>
  <li>IP address</li>
  <li>Usage data (such as screen views, session length)</li>
</ul>

<p>All such data is handled by the third-party providers according to their privacy policies, not by the Service Provider directly.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The app uses the following third-party services which may collect data according to their own privacy policies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob (Google)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>The Application is not directed to children under the age of 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect any personal data from children, nor does the app include features that request age or identity information.</p>

<p>The Application is not marked as child-directed in AdMob settings. The Service Provider does not collect user information, including age, and does not have control over how AdMob classifies or delivers ads. Ad delivery is handled entirely by AdMob in accordance with their policies.</p>

<h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>

<p>You can stop all use of the Application by uninstalling it. If you would like to request that third-party services delete data they may have collected, please refer to their respective privacy policies linked above.</p>

<h2>Manage Ads</h2>

<p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements in our app. Depending on your region, you may be shown a consent message asking whether you want to receive personalized ads:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>European Economic Area (EEA) & United Kingdom:</b> You will see a consent form where you can choose between personalized ads or non-personalized ads.</li>
  <li><b>California, USA:</b> You will see a consent message in line with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</li>
  <li><b>Other regions:</b> A consent form may not appear. In these cases, Google manages your ad settings by default.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if the consent form does not appear in your region, you can still manage ad personalization through your <b>device settings:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>On iOS: Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising > Personalized Ads.</li>
  <li>On Android: Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures you always have control over whether you receive personalized ads or more generic ads.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>The Application does not store or transmit personal data. Security of any information handled by third-party services is governed by their respective safeguards.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Any updates will be posted here.</p>

<p>This policy is effective as of 2025-09-03.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the Service Provider at:</p>
